      				<p>Hi, my name is Emei(Crystal) Tian. I am currently pursuing Masters in Engineering Entrepreneurship and Innovation degree from McMaster University.</p>
                    <p>After I graduated from University of Waterloo with Bachelor of Mathematics, specialising in financial analysis and risk management, I had a brief work experience as a Marketing Director in a food delivery start-up company. It gave me the opportunity to work in a fast-paced environment, and well-trained my capability of turning insights into actions that derive results. This work experience also inspired me for joining my current Master study of how to better solve market needs with my own innovative ventures. Moreover, the cross-functional implementations of my previous workplace including Operations, Finance and Technology are embedded in every team, which reminds me that “Knowledge is no burden.” I am also a CFA (Chartered Financial Analyst) level I Candidate, and planning to learn some technical courses through my Master journey to enhance my background.</p>
                    <p>On the way to become an successful entrepreneur, I believe that by continuing developing my personal leadership plan through my journey, my skills will be improved significantly in the future no matter I choose to pursue my own venture idea or hired by other established companies.</p>
                    <p>When I am outside schools, I have a one and a half year old French Bulldog name Jagger, he really brings me a lot of joy while I am stuck at home. I enjoy travelling with my family and experience different cultures in different places. I love taking photos because it helps me to recall those good memories.</p>
